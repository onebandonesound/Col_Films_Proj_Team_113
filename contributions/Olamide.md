The following are the descriptions of the tasks I was assigned in my team and the links to view them;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
1. During our 24 hours design sprint, I assisted our design team lead Emmanuella, as the assistant design team lead and coordinated the UX team in our project research whereby we brainstormed as a team to come up with our research background, problem statement, research objectives, research questions while I came up with the interview questions used in our research. I also came up with the user persona for our college student content creators interested in uploading videos on our platform while @Philemon worked with me on creating user persona for the general users that will be visiting our streaming platform to watch videos. Here's the link to our figjam file to show you the research outcome that informed our design process.

9. In addition to the above, as the assistant design team lead, I worked with the developers by making sure to carry them along with our design process and checking in with their implementations for accuracy. I made sure to keep team members on their toes so we can all deliver on our tasks on time. I got involved in every of our design process including those I seem to struggle with. This is so I can improve in my skills and be better for it after the project phase.
