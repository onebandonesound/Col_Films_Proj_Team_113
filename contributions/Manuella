My contributions to Team_113 project are as follows:

1. As design team lead, after urging my teammmates and myself to do preliminary research into our project idea to properly understand it, Olamide(assistant design
team lead) and I planned, organized and commenced a 24 hour design sprint for the entire design team. I assigned her to spearhead the UX team whilst I led the UI
team after assigning tasks to the Graphics team. In the UI team, I worked with my team members to create a style guide to reflect our brand in preparation of the 
UI designs. 
  - I designed the color system and published it as a style, which i later updated after getting feedback and brainstorming with my team member, Stella. 
  - I designed the spacing, icon, button system, checkboxes and added it to the team components.
  - I designed a new input field to refect our color and 8 grid system, dividing it into labelled and labeless inout fields.
  - I designed the left, left + back, and top navigation component.
  - I created a UI desktop checklist for the UI team to follow when designing the desktop screens.
  - I updated the style guide to reflect consistency, make some elements components and others.

11. Upload video page: Tesa worked with me as a UX writer and i designed the page to upload video. After first designing it, i did sveeral iteration to simplify 
    upload steps as one of the pain points from the research was over complicated and tasking process involved in uploading video. I was also careful not to over 
    simplify in avoidance of removing some key steps important to the upload process.

12. As design team lead, i worked with my team members, gave feedback and made updates to improve designs in order to reflect brand message, unique feel, style 
    guide and ensure consistency.
